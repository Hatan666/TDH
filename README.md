# The Dark Hordes

*Lead fugitive dark sorcerer Gwiti Ha’atel to mastery of the undead hordes.*

*(Intermediate level, 9 scenarios)*

# Unit Descriptions

## Initiate

*Dabbling in the Death Magic, this young Ha’atel’s lust for power has weakened him to the point where he is too weak to attack in regular combat.*

## Deathmaster

*His wanderings on a dark path have given him power normally not granted to mortals, but with a terrible cost: the undead that he gave his soul to are gradually claiming his mortal shell too, and with time, he will be a true undead and a terror to all that lives.*

## Grimreaper

(**TODO: Currently same as Deathmaster**)

## Demilich

*After too much time dabbling with forbidden magics and dark arts, these magi have begun to pay a heavy price. Demiliches have started losing their bodies, becoming undead themselves. With time, they may become fully undead, and feared by all alike.*

## Dread Lich

*At long last, Ha’atel has paid the ultimate sacrifice for the dark arts into which he has delved, and has, himself, entered into undeath. At the apex of his power, he has become a lich, a waking embodiment of dread. He has, beyond any doubt, passed the point of no return, and his power and immortality will have to provide consolation for what he has lost in his quest to achieve them.*

# Scenario: A New Chance

## Story

*At a great battle at the Stone of Erzen, the brothers Gwiti and Nati Ha’atel showed their skills for the first time: thinking that their side was losing the battle, they called upon the corpses of former enemies to rise again and fight on their side.*

*However, not only was this forbidden, but rash as well. The cavalry meant to come as reinforcements instead clashed with the undead legions, and so the battle was lost where it would have been won had it not been for these two dark sorcerers.*

*The Ha’atel brothers fled. However, they were seized by the Wesnothians not long after. They were clapped in irons, marched onto a ship with no rudder, and sent off to drown in the sea, for the Wesnothians feared that their corpses might only rise again.*

*But Fate intervened. The ship carrying Gwiti and Nati was beset by a sudden storm and disintegrated, separating the brothers and washing them both ashore. This was the beginning of the Rise of the Dark Hordes.*

## Sides

- *Gwiti Ha’atel*
- *Xabrak*
- *Grakarat*

## Objectives

- *Clear the land of monsters*
- *Death of Gwiti Ha’atel*

## Starting Events

**Gwiti is on the northwestern shore of the map, with Xabrak and Grakarat to the south and east, respectively.**

Narrator: *After his banishment from Wesnoth for practicing necromancy, the young Gwiti Ha’atel arrived on a strange shore. He decided to claim it for his own.*

Gwiti: *Apparently the gods have not yet completely abandoned me. The smell of the beast is in the air around here — perhaps they are the material for testing whether I shall survive.*

Gwiti: *Not sure why, but this ruin is filled with bones and souls... as if the dead bearing their regrets were waiting for me. This is to my convenience.*

## Turn 4 (Dawn)

Gwiti: *But I only wonder where my brother has disappeared to. Do the gods know that one surviving Ha’atel is enough?*

## Gwiti’s Attacking Dialogue

Gwiti: *Death is good for the nagas that bother me!*

## Grakarat’s Death

Grakarat: *Argh! I die!*

## Xabrak’s Death

Xabrak: *Where did he come from? We were supposed to have destroyed the cult in this area!*

Gwiti: *Cult? What is your saying?*

## Arkal-Thil’s Appearance (After Xabrak’s Death)

Gwiti: *Oops, there is someone hiding. Those who hide in the shadows of battle are doomed to a miserable end...*

**Arkal-Thil (Dark Adept) appears.**

Arkal: *Spare my life, I beg you! I was about to be devoured by them, but your darkness saved me...*

Gwiti: *Are you of my own kind? If you want mercy and more necromancy, come with me. Obey me and you will become more mighty.*

Arkal: *I sense power within you. The potential to surpass my father... I pledge myself to your hordes.*

### Updated Objectives

- *Clear the land of monsters*
- *Death of Gwiti Ha’atel*
- *Death of Arkal-Thil*

## Gwiti’s Death (Defeat)

Gwiti: *Noooo! Not now, not when I have escaped!*

## Arkal-Thil’s Death (Defeat)

Arkal: *Oh no! Am I foolish enough to obey him, and die like this?*

## Time Over (Defeat)

Gwiti: *The Wesnothians have discovered my escape! This is not good...*

## Enemies Defeated (Victory)

Gwiti: *These monsters are not worthy of being real opponents with whom I should confront. Even their souls shall serve my power.*

Arkal: *Where do we go from here, master?*

Gwiti: *I must seek for Nati, for I do not believe he perished as a prey to the waves. Though my brother, he was always my obstacle. If he lives... he will eventually stand before me.*

Arkal: *By the way, new master... there must be other brethren hiding besides me.*

Gwiti: *Your brethren? Looking back, the naga I killed also said some strange remarks. What transpired here?*

Arkal: *This beach was sacred ground for our cult, seekers of death’s power. But beasts attacked, our master’s strength failed... the rest were slaughtered, and the few survivors hid in shadows.*

Gwiti: *Well, now I knew why there had been so many traces of death when I arrived. But now, the monsters that plagued you are destined to rise again as our puppets... right?*
